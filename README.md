EDA Analysis- Assignment

it is requiredto provide recommendations to the Chief Ministers (CMs) of various states which will help them prioritise areas of development for their respective states. Since different states are in different phases of development, the recommendations should be specific to the states.

The overall goal of this project is to help the CMs focus on areas that will foster economic development for their respective states. Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, GDP of various states of India is to be analysed and ways to improve it are to be suggested.

<b> Data </b>
The data is sourced from https://data.gov.in/, an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India.  The data for GDP analysis of the Indian states is divided into two parts:

Data I-A: This dataset consists of the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.

Data I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry) and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies. There is separate dataset for each of the states. 

There are two parts to this project.:

In the first part, the GDPs of various Indian states (both total and per capita) will be anlysed and compared. Then, the states wwill be divided into four categories based on the GDP per capita, and for each of these four categories, the sectors that contribute the most to the GDP (such as agriculture, real estate, manufacturing, etc.) will be identified

 
In the second part, analysis will be performed to check whether GDP per capita is related to dropout rates in schools and colleges.
